    <div class="entry">
      <strong>Credit Risk Predictor Dashboard</strong>
      <p>
        Developed a full-stack machine learning dashboard that evaluates the risk of loan default for financial institutions.
        Leveraged models such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost to predict borrower reliability, and implemented SHAP for detailed interpretability and transparency of predictions.
        The dashboard allows financial analysts to input borrower data, visualize risk levels in real time, and interpret feature importance for regulatory and business decision-making.
        Integrated Flask for backend routing, Streamlit for interactive frontend, and automated data pipelines for end-to-end model deployment and testing.

    <div class="entry">
      <strong>EV Stock Prediction Dashboard</strong>
      <p>
        Designed a robust forecasting dashboard that predicts stock trends for electric vehicle companies using advanced ML techniques.
        Combined LSTM neural networks and XGBoost for time series forecasting and classification based on macroeconomic indicators like oil prices, sentiment analysis from news sources, and volume trends.
        Used BeautifulSoup for real-time news scraping and integrated Matplotlib visualizations for accessible data insights.
        The tool supports scenario testing and comparison across multiple stocks and timelines, aimed at financial analysts and traders.

      <strong>Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic</strong>
      <p>
        Developed a system to monitor and analyze network traffic for detecting unusual or malicious activity in real time.
        Utilized machine learning models including Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM to distinguish normal patterns from potential threats.
        Integrated logging and visualization tools to trace anomalies to specific source IPs and timestamps, enabling quicker incident response.
        The system was designed to be extensible and applicable across multiple enterprise network architectures, emphasizing low latency and high throughput.

    <div class="entry">
      <strong>IoT Network Overload Attack Prevention</strong>
      <p>
        Built a lightweight security module for IoT devices to protect against network saturation and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
        Implemented a rate-limiting algorithm and adaptive threshold system that detects overload patterns and proactively throttles malicious traffic.
        Simulated various overload scenarios using Python and Scapy, and evaluated the system using throughput and latency metrics.
        Enhanced device reliability and reduced failure rates by incorporating real-time monitoring and anomaly response pipelines.

    <div class="entry">
      <strong>Phishing Email Detection System</strong>
      <p>
        Created a comprehensive phishing detection tool that analyzes incoming email content and metadata to identify potential phishing attacks.
        Employed supervised machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and SVM with a carefully engineered feature set based on URL patterns, email headers, and suspicious keywords.
        Achieved over 92% detection accuracy on benchmark datasets and integrated results into a secure and lightweight API for deployment in enterprise email systems.
        Included explainability features and a visual interface for cybersecurity analysts to audit model decisions and fine-tune detection thresholds.
